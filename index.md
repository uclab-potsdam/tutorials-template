# Documentation of UClab coding challenges

Here lives the documentation for the coding challenges. Each challenge will have one or more outcome.
Outcomes are short (and focused!) examples that illustrate how to code a specific feature of a visualization.
Features are drawn from Figueiras (2015) [^1] and Brehmer and Munzner (2013) [^2]
