# Code challenges
This repo contains the code challenges and their documentation. 

### Boilerplate folder
For now, it contains the plain vanilla JS template. Potentially we cane expand by adding other templates if needed.

### Challenges folder
This folder contains one subfolder for each individual challenge. In order to participate in the challenge each participant needs to create their subfolder and copy/create a template to start coding. The code can be explained and documented by using the (documentation page)[https://uclab-potsdam.github.io/tutorials-template/] available on the `pages` branch of this repo.

### To do:
[]Update of documentation to explain how the project works
[]Creation of a overview page for challenges
[]Better description of project
